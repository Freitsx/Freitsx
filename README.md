## 👋🏻 About Me
American* Frontend Developer, I like to be creative, responsible and organized; 2024 was the year when I started programming, "Why Frontend?" just beacuse we can create websites, pages and make beautiful projects - I was born and raised in Brazil but in 2020 my love for America started, was like "Finally I have a Objective"; - my personality is be a very good person who likes honestly and fight for what's right; as a Developer would be a pleasure work together, make friends and talk about ours goals; So nice to meet you who is in my profile.
